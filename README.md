# Panic Attacks Data Analysis – Power BI Project  

## Overview  
This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of panic attack cases using data sourced from **SNOWFLAKE**. By visualizing patient symptoms, panic scores, triggers, medical history, and lifestyle factors, this project aims to uncover meaningful insights that can aid in understanding panic attacks and their potential causes.  

## Data Insights  
### Key Findings  
- **Symptoms Prevalence:**  
  - **Dizziness:** Affects **620** patients (~51.67%).  
  - **Trembling:** Reported by **590** patients.  
  - **Sweating, shortness of breath, and chest pain** vary significantly across the dataset.  

- **Panic Score Distribution:**  
  - Categorized as **High, Medium, and Low** across gender groups (**Male, Female, Non-Binary**).  
  - Panic scores correlate with factors like sleep hours, anxiety disorders, and triggers.  

- **Lifestyle & Mental Health Triggers:**  
  - Patients with **Caffeine dependence, PTSD, Phobia, Depression, and Anxiety** show significant variations in panic attack frequency and severity.  
  - **Sleep Hours & Age Groups:**  
    - Adolescents with **Caffeine dependence, PTSD, Phobia, or Social Anxiety** have **lower average sleep hours** compared to adults.  
  - **Panic Attack Duration:** Episodes last between **10 to 40 minutes**.  
  - **Alcohol Consumption:** Weekly drink counts range from **104 to 132**.  

## Suggestions & Recommendations  
- **Monitor Sleep Patterns:** Patients with insufficient sleep (≤5 hours) show higher panic attack frequency. Encouraging **healthy sleep habits** can help reduce occurrences.  
- **Caffeine & Alcohol Moderation:** Reducing caffeine intake and alcohol consumption may assist in controlling anxiety-related panic attacks.  
- **Personalized Treatment Plans:** Since triggers like **PTSD, Phobia, and Anxiety Disorders** significantly affect panic scores, **custom interventions** based on personal history may be beneficial.  
- **Lifestyle Adjustments:** Incorporating **stress-reducing activities, therapy, and relaxation techniques** could mitigate panic symptoms.  

## Conclusion  
This Power BI project provides **data-driven insights** into panic attack patterns and associated factors. By analyzing medical history, symptoms, and behavioral tendencies, this dashboard serves as a **valuable tool for healthcare providers, researchers, and patients** to better understand panic disorders.  

## Data Source  
This dataset is sourced from **SNOWFLAKE** and analyzed using **Power BI** to provide meaningful insights.
